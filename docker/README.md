### This directory is used to provide scripts and data for Docker builds.

## Notes
There is no need to build a Docker image yourself, the image is available on Docker Hub: [defaltsimon/nano](https://hub.docker.com/r/defaltsimon/nano).


##
These files should replace standard ones. This makes sure that stuff like logs, etc. are put into /data and not elsewhere.
